# üöÄ How to Build This Project: A Complete Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates how to use **Knowledge Docs Templates** to systematically build a complete, production-ready application from scratch. This methodology ensures consistency, clarity, and maintainability across all development phases.

## üìã Overview

The **Requirements Creator** project serves as a perfect example of how structured documentation can guide the entire development process. This walkthrough shows you exactly how to:

1. **Define your project foundation** with clear constraints and goals
2. **Scope your features** with realistic boundaries and phases
3. **Structure your codebase** with consistent patterns
4. **Guide AI development** with specific prompts and patterns
5. **Test your implementation** with real-world scenarios

## üéØ The Methodology

### Phase 1: Foundation Definition

**File: `knowledge_docs/FOUNDATION_KNOWLEDGE.md`**

This file establishes the core principles and constraints that guide every decision:

```markdown
## Build Philosophy
- **Core Values**: Precision, Automation, Reliability, User Experience
- **Primary Focus**: Technical excellence in dependency management and code analysis
- **Development Priority**: Balance between code quality and practical utility

## AI Agent Roles & Division of Labor
- **Cursor Role:** Backend logic, Flask routes, code analysis algorithms
- **Replit Role:** Frontend components (HTML/CSS/JS), user interface design
- **ChatGPT Role:** Project scoping, documentation refinement, prompt creation
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear role definitions prevent confusion and overlap
- Specific constraints (Flask backend, HTML/CSS frontend) guide technology choices
- Build philosophy ensures consistent decision-making

### Phase 2: Project Scoping

**File: `knowledge_docs/SCOPE_DOC.md`**

This file defines exactly what you're building and what you're NOT building:

```markdown
## One-line Summary
Automatically generate precise Python requirements.txt files by analyzing your codebase and matching function signatures to compatible library versions.

## What We're Building
- **Functionality Overview:** Code analysis tool that scans Python files, detects library imports and function calls, matches them against a signature database, and generates requirements.txt with exact compatible versions

## What We're NOT Building
- Complex dependency resolution algorithms or conflict resolution
- Integration with version control systems or CI/CD platforms
- Real-time collaborative features or multi-user sessions
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear boundaries prevent scope creep
- Specific exclusions help maintain focus
- Realistic constraints ensure achievable goals

### Phase 3: Architecture Planning

**File: `knowledge_docs/STRUCTURE_MAP.md`**

This file defines the exact project structure and responsibilities:

```markdown
## Directory Layout
```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                     # Flask web application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                    # CLI interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                       # Core logic modules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code_analyzer.py       # Python code analysis
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements_creator.py # Main orchestration class
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/                 # Flask templates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/                   # Static assets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ signature_database/       # Library signature storage
```

## Layer Responsibilities
- **/src:** Core business logic, code analysis, signature matching, PyPI integration
- **/templates:** Flask HTML templates for web interface
- **/static:** CSS styles and static assets
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear file organization prevents confusion
- Specific responsibilities guide development
- Consistent patterns across the codebase

### Phase 4: AI Development Guidance

**File: `knowledge_docs/AGENT_PROMPT_MAP.md`**

This file provides specific prompts for different AI agents:

```markdown
## Cursor Prompts (Backend Development)
- "Add a new route in `app.py` for receiving code analysis form submission"
- "Implement logic in `/src` to process Python code analysis"
- "Update `requirements_creator.py` to include new analysis method"

## Replit Prompts (Frontend Development)
- "Create a clean HTML form to input Python code"
- "Generate `demo.html` template to display analysis results"
- "Build a table UI that displays generated requirements.txt"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Specific prompts reduce ambiguity
- Role-based guidance ensures proper task distribution
- Consistent patterns across development

### Phase 5: Intelligent Logic Design

**File: `knowledge_docs/AGENTIC_LOGIC_GUIDE.md`**

This file defines how the system should make decisions and handle complex scenarios:

```markdown
## Intelligent Processing Patterns
- **Context Management:** Stateless design - each analysis request is independent
- **Decision Making:** Pattern recognition for Python imports and function calls
- **Response Generation:** Coordinate code analysis, signature matching, and PyPI queries

## External Service Integration
- **Service Management:** Single PyPI client manages all external API calls
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback when PyPI unavailable, local database backup
- **Performance Optimization:** Store library signatures locally to reduce API calls
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear decision-making patterns
- Robust error handling strategies
- Performance optimization guidelines

### Phase 6: Real-World Testing

**File: `knowledge_docs/REALITY_TESTS.md`**

This file defines exactly how the system should behave in real scenarios:

```markdown
## Sample Data Payloads
### Code Input Example
```python
import numpy as np
import requests
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/add')
def add_numbers():
    result = np.add(5, 3)
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com', timeout=5)
    return str(result)
```

## Critical User Flows
- **Primary Flow:** User inputs Python code ‚Üí System analyzes imports and functions ‚Üí Matches against signature database ‚Üí Generates requirements.txt ‚Üí Displays results
- **Error Flow:** Invalid code input ‚Üí System shows validation error ‚Üí User corrects and resubmits
```

**Why This Works:**
- Real examples guide implementation
- Clear user flows ensure good UX
- Edge cases prevent common failures

## üîÑ The Development Process
