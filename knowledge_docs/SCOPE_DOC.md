# SCOPE_DOC

## One-line Summary
Automatically generate precise Python requirements.txt files by analyzing your codebase and matching function signatures to compatible library versions.

## What We're Building
- **Functionality Overview:** Code analysis tool that scans Python files, detects library imports and function calls, matches them against a signature database, and generates requirements.txt with exact compatible versions
- **Input Behavior:** Accepts Python code files/directories (CLI) or code strings (web interface) for analysis
- **Output Behavior:** Generates requirements.txt files with pinned versions, provides web interface with real-time analysis results
- **Core Logic Description:** Analyzes Python code for imports and function calls, matches against library signature database, queries PyPI for version compatibility, generates precise requirements
- **Intelligent Processing:** Signature-based matching to determine exact library versions that support the detected function usage

## What We're NOT Building
- Complex dependency resolution algorithms or conflict resolution
- Integration with version control systems or CI/CD platforms
- Real-time collaborative features or multi-user sessions
- Advanced code parsing beyond import and function call detection
- User authentication or project management features

## External Dependencies
- **Primary Services:** PyPI API for library metadata and version information
- **Secondary Services:** None - designed to be self-contained with local signature database
- **Rate Limits & Costs:** Free PyPI API usage with rate limiting considerations
- **Fallback Strategies:** Local signature database provides offline functionality, graceful degradation when PyPI unavailable

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** Sub-second analysis for typical Python projects (< 100 files)
- **Concurrency:** Single-user web interface, CLI designed for sequential processing
- **Resource Usage:** Minimal memory footprint, efficient signature database storage
- **Scalability:** Focus on accuracy over speed, designed for development workflows

## Single Feature Use Case
- **Real-world Problem:** Developers waste hours debugging dependency conflicts and version mismatches
- **User Story:** As a Python developer, I want to automatically generate a requirements.txt with exact versions that work with my code so that I can avoid dependency conflicts and deployment issues

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Logic + Data Structures
- **Backend Checklist:** Code analyzer, signature extractor, version matcher, database manager, PyPI client
- **Frontend Checklist:** Basic web interface with code input form and results display
- **External Integration:** PyPI API integration for library metadata

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- **Backend Checklist:** CLI interface, batch operations, auto-add missing libraries, database statistics
- **Frontend Checklist:** Responsive design, sample code examples, copy-to-clipboard, covered libraries display
- **Integration Enhancement:** Improved error handling, fallback mechanisms, better user feedback

### Phase 3: Quality & Optimization
- **Backend Checklist:** Comprehensive error handling, performance optimization, signature database expansion
- **Frontend Checklist:** Professional landing page, improved UX, accessibility features
- **Testing & Validation:** Unit tests, integration tests, real-world codebase validation

## Real Data Requirements
- **Example Data Structures:** Python library function signatures with version compatibility data
- **Expected Data Sources:** PyPI API for library metadata, local signature database for caching
- **Data Relationships:** Function signatures mapped to library versions, import statements linked to requirements
- **Data Validation:** Signature format validation, version compatibility verification, code syntax checking
